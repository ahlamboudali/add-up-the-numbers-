```js
function addUp(num) {
  return (num * (num + 1))/2;
}
```

## Strategy

The problem involves finding the sum of integers from 1 to the given input number, num. This task can be efficiently tackled using a mathematical formula known as the sum of an arithmetic series. 

## Implementation

- Mathematical Formula: Utilize the formula (num * (num + 1)) / 2
- to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to the given input number num.

## Possible Refactors

Although the current solution efficiently uses a mathematical formula, alternative strategies like iteration or recursion are possible. However, these approaches may increase complexity without significant performance improvements.
